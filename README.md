# 🥗 FoodLoop – Bridging Surplus Food with Community Needs

**FoodLoop** is a web platform that connects food retailers with nearby NGOs to reduce food waste and support communities. Retailers can list surplus food that would otherwise go to waste, and NGOs can request or claim it to help those in need.

## 🏠 Homepage

The homepage introduces users to the purpose of FoodLoop—highlighting how the platform connects surplus food from retailers with NGOs in the same locality (based on pincode). The design is clean, intuitive, and encourages users to log in or sign up to start contributing.

### 📦 Inventory Management

Retailers can add, update, list, or mark items as sold. Each inventory item displays essential information including the food name, purchase date, best-before date, and expiration date. 

Retailers can also "List" an item for NGOs or mark it as "Sold" to remove it from circulation.

Retailers can also view a list of food requests submitted by NGOs in the same pincode and choose to connect with them.

## 🏥 NGO Dashboard

NGOs have their own tailored dashboard that helps them view surplus food available nearby and submit requests for food items they need.

### 🧭 NGO Dashboard View

Upon logging in, NGOs can immediately see food items listed by retailers in their pincode area. Each card shows the food item’s name, condition, and other key details.
